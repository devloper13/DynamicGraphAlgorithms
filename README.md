# DynamicGraphAlgorithms

Name of the report : APSReport.pdf

1. Dynamic Dijkstra's Algorithm:

    To run Dijkstra's algorithm follow the below commands:
    
    1. Go inside the folder named Dijkstra's by typing following command in terminal: cd Dijkstra\'s/

    2. g++ DynamicDijkstra.cpp
    
    3. ./a.out < [testcase file] > [ouputfile]
    
    Example: ./a.out < ./Testcases/Input/testcase1000 > output1000

    You may check the accuracy from the already existing output files.
    The output file for testcase1000 is output1000, testcase 2000 is output2000 and so on.
    
    Input  files are present in /Testcases/Input
    
    Output files are present in /Testcases/Output
    
    
    
    
2. Dynamic DFS Algorithm:

    To run DFS algorithm follow the below commands:
    
    1. Go inside the folder named DynamicDFS by typing following command in terminal: cd DynamicDFS

    2. g++ DynamicDFS.cpp
    
    3. ./a.out < [testcase file] > [ouputfile]
    
    Example: ./a.out < ./Testcases/Input/test1 > output1

    You may check the accuracy from the already existing output files.
    The output file for test1 is output1, test 2 is output2 and so on. 
    
    Input  files are present in /Testcases/Input
    
    Output files are present in the /Testcases/Output
